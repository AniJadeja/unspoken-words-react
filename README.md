# Unspoken Words

This project has the code for my personal portfolio website. The live website can be accessed on this url(https://unspoken-words-r.web.app)

This project was built to display my abilities. This project is backed by firebase realtime database to fetch the data. The project follows MVC structure to display and processs data. The project also follows encapsulation principles. It has nice and subtle animations to keep the users engaged and still a focused ui to keep the distractions out.
